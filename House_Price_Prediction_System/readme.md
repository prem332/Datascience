# House Price Prediction System

This project predicts house prices based on various input features using machine learning regression models. The best-performing model, **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, has been deployed in a web application to provide real-time house price predictions.

## Features
- Predict house prices based on input features like square footage, number of rooms, location, etc.
- Uses multiple regression models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - KNeighborsRegressor
  - DecisionTreeRegressor
  - RandomForestRegressor
  - XGBoost
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Web application for easy interaction and predictions.
